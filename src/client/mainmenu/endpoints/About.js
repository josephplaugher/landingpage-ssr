        <p className="text">
            Founder Joseph Plaugher repeatedly experienced ineffective, slow,
            and tedius processes being utilized at a variety of organizations.
            Knowing the power of software to automate business processes, which
            has allowed companies such as Amazon, Ebay, Google, and many others
            to drastically cut costs and become superpowers in their industry,
            Joseph wanted to bring this competitive advantage to small
            businesses who can't neccessarily afford their own technology team.
