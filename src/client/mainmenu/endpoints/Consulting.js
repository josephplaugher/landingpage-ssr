            We seek to understand your pain point - the part of your business
            process that is ineffficient, expensive, or just a hassle - and we
            will work to alleviate the "pain" and automate it using software.

            Sometimes a desktop application is appropriate if only a couple of
            people need access to the application and only when at work. If more
            than a couple of people need access or there is shared data
            involved, a web-based application is usually a great option. We can
            do either one!
