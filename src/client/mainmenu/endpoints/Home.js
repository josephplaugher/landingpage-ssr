            can be automated. Which means you have inefficiencies in your
            workflow that you may not be aware of.

        <h2 className="subheadline">Expand Without Increasing Labor Costs</h2>
        <p1 className="text">
            Wondering if you need to hire more staff to expand your business?
            Maybe you don't. If your staff's time was less consumed with
            routine, tedious tasks, there will be more time for effective and
            productive work. They will be happier, and your bottom line will
            benefit.
